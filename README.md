Prediction Model to calculate the death odds of Covid-19 

In this project, we focused on analyzing official recent data of covid-19 patients in order to forecast what could be their risk to pass away from the illness. The selected machine learning model was Support-vector machine due to its optimal R-squared value in the training process.

We concluded the research calculating confidence intervals of death likelihood from test data and deploying an interactive dashboard submitted in shiny. The dashboard can be viewed in the following link: https://analyticsrlun.shinyapps.io/projectcovid/.
